Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî this is how a real engineer + researcher thinks, Edwin. Let‚Äôs turn the **FirewallX Interactive Firewall Simulator** into a *guided, milestone-based roadmap* ‚Äî structured like a professional development plan for both the **academic presentation** and **portfolio-ready web project**.

# üéØ **PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

### üß± **Main Goal**

To design and develop an **interactive full-stack web application** that demonstrates the **functionality and logic of firewalls** ‚Äî allowing users to visualize, simulate, and understand how packets are filtered, blocked, or allowed based on predefined security rules.

---

## üîç **Specific Objectives**

1. **Educational Objective**
   To provide an intuitive, web-based simulation tool that illustrates how different types of firewalls (packet-filtering, stateful inspection) operate in real time.

2. **Technical Objective**
   To build a **Flask backend** that processes simulated packet data using rule-based filtering logic and serves the results to a **React frontend** visualization dashboard.

3. **Visualization Objective**
   To represent network packets, filtering decisions, and firewall logs using **animated charts, traffic graphs, and dynamic visuals** (e.g., green = allowed, red = denied).

4. **Analytical Objective**
   To generate and display logs showing allowed/blocked packets, showing how firewall decisions evolve as new rules are applied.

5. **Integration Objective**
   To enable **rule management** (add/update/delete rules) and **live simulation** features, highlighting how administrators interact with firewall systems.

6. **Demonstration Objective**
   To showcase this system as part of the **academic presentation**, linking theoretical knowledge (from the research paper) to an applied, working prototype.

# üóìÔ∏è **PROJECT DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE (3‚Äì4 Weeks Plan)**

Below is a *chronological breakdown* of what to develop first, in what order, and what files/folders to populate at each stage.

---

## üß© **WEEK 1: PROJECT FOUNDATION**

**Goal:** Set up the development environment and core structure.

### üóÇÔ∏è Tasks

* Initialize repo and environment:

  ```bash
  mkdir firewallx && cd firewallx  
  npx create-vite@latest frontend  
  mkdir backend && cd backend && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate  
  pip install flask flask-cors  
  ```
* Create base folders:

  * `/backend` ‚Üí `app.py`, `routes/`, `models/`, `services/`, `utils/`
  * `/frontend/src` ‚Üí `components/`, `pages/`, `services/`, `styles/`
* Configure **Flask API base** (`app.py`):

  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  from flask_cors import CORS

  app = Flask(__name__)
  CORS(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def index():
      return {'message': 'FirewallX Backend Running'}
  ```

‚úÖ **Deliverable:** Flask server runs successfully, and React app launches (`npm run dev`).

---

## üß† **WEEK 2: BACKEND LOGIC & SIMULATION ENGINE**

**Goal:** Implement the backend that drives packet/rule behavior.

### üóÇÔ∏è Files to Populate:

* **`backend/services/firewall_engine.py`**

  * Handles rule evaluation (ALLOW/DENY)
  * Defines `process_packet(packet, rules)` function
* **`backend/routes/packet_routes.py`**

  * Endpoint: `POST /api/packets/simulate`
    Accepts a simulated packet JSON, applies rules, returns ‚Äúallowed‚Äù or ‚Äúblocked.‚Äù
* **`backend/routes/rule_routes.py`**

  * Endpoint: `GET /api/rules`, `POST /api/rules`, `DELETE /api/rules/:id`
* **`backend/utils/mock_data.py`**

  * Generates fake packets: random source IP, destination, ports, protocols.

‚úÖ **Deliverable:**
API returns correct simulation responses. Example test with Postman or curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/packets/simulate -d '{"src":"192.168.1.10","dest":"10.0.0.5","port":80,"protocol":"TCP"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

---

## üíª **WEEK 3: FRONTEND VISUALIZATION (React Layer)**

**Goal:** Create an interactive, educational interface.

### üóÇÔ∏è Populate Frontend Files:

* **`frontend/src/pages/Simulator.jsx`**

  * Central page hosting the visualization dashboard.
* **`frontend/src/components/PacketVisualizer.jsx`**

  * Animates packet flow through the firewall (green/red circles).
* **`frontend/src/components/RuleEditor.jsx`**

  * Simple CRUD UI for managing firewall rules.
* **`frontend/src/components/LogTable.jsx`**

  * Displays firewall decision logs (timestamp, IP, port, status).
* **`frontend/src/services/api.js`**

  * Central API handler: `axios` calls to Flask routes.

‚úÖ **Deliverable:**
You can add/edit rules ‚Üí simulate ‚Üí watch packets move and logs update in real-time.

---

## üìà **WEEK 4: INTEGRATION, POLISHING & PRESENTATION**

**Goal:** Polish UI, integrate features, prepare for the demo.

### üß© Tasks:

* Integrate backend and frontend via `VITE_API_URL` in `.env`.
* Add **real-time visuals** (Chart.js or Framer Motion).
* Polish **styling** (`/frontend/src/styles/`): smooth animations for packets & transitions.
* Populate:

  * `frontend/src/pages/About.jsx` ‚Üí explain project objectives.
  * `docs/DESIGN_OVERVIEW.md` ‚Üí the explanation notes for the professor.
  * `docs/FIREWALL_LOGIC.md` ‚Üí summarize rule evaluation logic.
* Create **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml** for portability.
* Record a **short screen demo** for the slides or host on **Vercel + Render**.

‚úÖ **Deliverable:**
A fully working demo you can show live or via browser ‚Äî explaining how packets are filtered dynamically.
